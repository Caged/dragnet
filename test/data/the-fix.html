<p>As the White House seeks to regroup on health care before Congress returns next month, the president and his senior officials face a problem as old as politics: how to effectively combat misinformation about the bill.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32464936/ns/politics-white_house/">Polling done earlier this week by NBC</a> shows the extent of the challenge before the Obama administration. Fifty five percent of those tested said illegal immigrants would get health care under the legislation while 54 percent said they believed passage of the bill would lead to a government takeover of the system.  Nearly half (45 percent) said that the legislation would allow the government to make decision about the medical care of the elderly -- hello death panels!</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hfODLR0wl7aBmaQ38Za6eyzLJ9hQD9A6710O0">Associated Press</a> and the <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/19/2036015.aspx">NBC Political Unit</a>, each of those claims have -- at best -- a thread of truth to them.</p>

<p>No matter.  Perception matters greatly in politics, a point that has been proven time and time again in the history of campaigns.  </p>

<p>The challenge for the Obama administration is that to find ways to rebut the misinformation about the plan, is to, in essence, try to disprove a negative. </p>

<p>Two factors complicate those efforts. </p>

<p>First, because the health care bill is so complicated it is easy for those who seek to capsize the legislation to cherry-pick elements to make their case against it.</p>

<p>Second, the fact that the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/08/19/in_the_absence_of_specifics_pu.html">president has not come out in favor of specific elements of a bill</a> he favors -- preferring instead to speak in terms of general principles he supports and leaving it up to Congress to hash out the specifics -- means that there is nothing hard and fast for Obama supporters around which to rally.</p>

<p>"The reality is that in order to sell a plan there has to be a plan, and when that day comes Obama is still the most effective spokesperson for saying what it is and what it is not," said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. </p>

<p>The White House's first attempt to catalog and push back against the various charges being made against the plan was <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26188.html">scuttled earlier this week</a> amid claims that it amounted to a "monitoring" system of the American public.</p>

<p>Unbowed, the Democratic National Committee has unveiled "<a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/settingtherecord">Setting the Record Straight</a>" -- a Web site designed to equip Obama supporters with the information needed to combat the misinformation floating in the political ether about health care. The site is modeled on "<a href="http://www.fightthesmears.com/">Fight the Smears</a>", a site set up during the campaign to respond in real-time to allegations being made against Obama and his policies.</p>

<p>Can a Web site turn around the perception problem the Obama Administration faces? Probably not. </p>

<p>And, like it or not, it's hard to look at the NBC/WSJ numbers and conclude anything other than that the opponents of reform have run a more effective campaign against the bill than its supporters have run in its favor.</p>

<p>How can the Obama administration ultimately win the perception battle?  </p>

<p>Get behind a specific plan, according to Garin. "The NBC poll shows there is majority support for the basic outlines of what is likely to be the plan -- so when the public is dealing with something tangible rather than the Republicans' straw men, the debate moves to better terrain for the White House."</p>

<p>And, once that plan is laid out, make sure it passes, said Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster.  "A deal is the only way to rebut the criticism," said Schoen. "Bipartisan ideally, but that is increasingly unlikely to happen."</p>

<p>The truth is that, as the campaign showed, there is no way to totally rebut pervasive rumors. By election day 2008 there were still those voters who believed Obama was a Muslim despite scads of evidence to the contrary. What the Obama campaign had done effectively by that point, however, was marginalize those rumors -- making sure the election turned on the broader themes of hope and change.</p>

<p>Can they pull off that same sort of broadening when it comes to the ongoing misinformation campaign health care?</p> <a id="more"/> <p>Thursday's Must Reads:</p>

<p><strong>Club On Air Against Grassley, Snowe and Enzi. . .</strong>: The Club for Growth, a third-party group that has shown a willingness to hit Republicans who are not sufficiently loyal to their fiscally conservative positioning, is at it again. The Club's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEH4_dfzzF8">new ads</a> aim to pressure Sens. <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> (Iowa), <strong>Olympia Snowe </strong>(Maine) and <strong>Mike Enzi </strong>(Wyo.) -- the three Republican negotiators on the health care reform bill -- not to give in to Democratic demands on the legislation. "There's no harm in talking," says the ad's narrator before detailing a laundry list of alleged problems with the legislation including "government-run insurance that pushes you out of your current plan,"  "job killing regulations on small businesses," and  "massive tax hikes." The ads, which will run in each senator's home state and are part of a $1.2 million advertising effort on health care from the Club, end by urging the trio "not to cave into the liberals on health care." </p>

<p><strong>. . .Patriot Majority On Liberal Talk Radio</strong>: Patriot Majority, an issue-advocacy group that spent heavily on behalf of Democratic candidates during the 2008 election, is sponsoring radio ads on liberal talk radio shows urging supporters of the president's health care plan to stand up and be counted.  The ads, which are running on the shows of Bill Press, Thom Hartmann, Stephanie Miller, Mike Malloy, Ed Schultz, Alan Combs, and the Reverend Al Sharpton, urge support for a plan that, among other things, includes the so-called "public option." The ad's narrator urges listeners to call their members of Congress and tell them "it's their patriotic duty to support health care reform."  Craig Varoga, a Democratic consultant who runs Patriot Majority, said that "there's a lot of noise and disinformation out there" and the goal of the group's ads are to "get the word to Members of Congress from those who support real reform." The funding for the ads is coming from organized labor led by the Sheet Metal Workers, according to Varoga.</p>

<p><strong>Lamontagne's Next Step</strong>: Businessman <strong>Ovide Lamontagne </strong>(R) will launch a <a href="http://www.discoverovide.com">Web site</a> today to allow him to interact with New Hampshire voters, the next step in his exploration of a Senate race in the Granite State. Lamontagne has been actively considering primary bid against former New Hampshire attorney general <strong>Kelly Ayotte</strong> for weeks and, according to those close to him, is moving toward such a candidacy. Lamontagne, who was the party's 1996 nominee for governor, would almost certainly run to Ayotte's ideological right -- a potentially strong position given the makeup of the New Hampshire Republican primary.  Democrats have cleared their field for Rep. <strong>Paul Hodes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>McCollum Leads in Florida</strong>: State Attorney General <strong>Bill McCollum</strong> (R) holds a 38 percent to 34 percent edge over state Chief Financial Officer <strong>Alex Sink</strong>(D) in the 2010 governor's race in the Sunshine State, according to a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1297.xml?ReleaseID=1366">new Quinnipiac poll</a>. Before Republicans rejoice, however, it's worth noting that Florida voters have only the vaguest idea about the two candidates. Nearly seven in ten voters (68 percent) said they didn't know enough about Sink to offer an opinion while 43 percent said the same of McCollum. Given the relatively low name ID scores for both candidates, money will be absolutely critical to determining a winner.  Whichever candidate is able to raise more cash will be able to fund more ads to not only define themselves positively but also cast their opponent in a negative light. In a state as large and cost-prohibitive as Florida, money isn't everything, it's the only thing.</p>

<p><strong>Republican Prospects Look Up in Kentucky</strong>: A <a href="http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d9c984f5-5f5f-45c6-9025-a518f7341b19">new Survey USA poll</a> in Kentucky shows that Sen. <strong>Jim Bunning</strong>'s (R) decision to retire has drastically increased his party's chances of holding his seat next November. Secretary of State <strong>Trey Grayson</strong>, the Republican frontrunner, led state Attorney General <strong>Jack Conway</strong> (D) 44 percent to 37 percent and Lt. Gov. <strong>Dan Mongiardo</strong> (D) 46 percent to 40 percent in the survey, a significant improvement over Bunning's dismal poll numbers. In  the battle for the Republican nomination, Grayson leads Rand Paul, the son of Texas Rep. Ron Paul 37 percent to 26 percent; Mongiardo holds a 39 percent to 31 percent edge over Conway in the Democratic primary.  Those numbers, particularly on the Democratic side, may be slightly deceiving, however, as Conway has drastically outraised Mongiardo to date and sits in a far stronger position to make his case to primary voters at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Strand to DSCC</strong>: <strong>Kathleen Strand</strong>, who served as communications director for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>'s New Hampshire campaign and for the New York senator's political action committee, has returned to her native Chicago to work as a senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee with a special focus on the Illinois race. Strand will be tasked with keeping the open seat caused by the retirement of Sen. <strong>Roland Burris</strong> in Democratic hands in 2010.  That won't be an easy task given the candidacy of Rep. <strong>Mark Kirk </strong>(R) who is widely regarded as the strongest candidate Republicans could have fielded. State Treasurer <strong>Lexi</strong> -- yes we know his full name is Alexi -- <strong>Giannoulias</strong> is the frontrunner for the Democratic nod although <strong>Cheryle Jackson</strong>, the head of the Chicago Urban League, is also running.  Although Strand is working under contract with the DSCC, she will remain a partner in Dover Strategy Group, a Democratic consulting firm.</p>

<p><strong>Say What?</strong>: "I haven't done anything legally wrong." -- Nevada Sen. <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gAKHK5xBT5NdBleTXH5_-Htc2p4QD9A66P481">John Ensign</a></strong> (R) comes clean (not) in an interview with the Associated Press.</p>

				<p>I know I've posted this before, but I'll say it again because there are so many new posters.  The model for the reformed program is the Federal Employee Health Benefit program (FEHB).  Every Federal employee (including Congress -- so everyone who wants the same coverage Specter has should be supporting this) across the country gets coverage this way.</p>

<p>1) Federal bean counters write different kinds of policies following sound medical standards.  These include HMOs, hi deduct/lo premium, and traditional BC/BS type insurance. <br/>
2) The same insurance companies everyone else uses bid to be included in the Federal exchange.  Their policies have to meet the standards written and because they will be competing for a portion of a very large pool, they have to price their policies competitively.<br/>
3) Once a year I can review all the policies and pick the one that suits my family and my purse best.  The price is the same for a year (one price for an individual employee, a higher price for an employee with a family).The price is the same to all employees -- it is not higher because I am now 53, not 28, or because I have been diagnosed with feline leukemia.<br/>
4)  I pay 1/3 of the premium, my employer pays 2/3 (just like you do -- if you are lucky and have employer-based insurance). <br/>
5) This federally administered program pays for itself while providing well-defined coverage at a good price.  My BC/BS policy is $550 a month for my family of 4.<br/>
6) The insurance companies are making enough money that they WANT to be included in this program.  I live in Philadelphia and I can choose from about 15 different policies  Aetna, Amerihealth, Kaiser, etc.<br/>
7) My insurer NEVER touches my bank account.  My share is taken from my paycheck and direct deposited to the insurer.  Uncle Sammy and BC/BS do NOT touch my bank accounts.  REALLY.</p>

<p>The gov't is already running several successful medical insurance programs.  They also run the ret. military coverage that Sestak credits for saving his daughter, the VA hospitals that have shown great improvement and Medicare (my friends in their late 50s look forward to the day they qualify).  This program keeps Kennedy and Byrd reporting for work (for now) and has continued to cover Specter.  <br/>
None of these guys were dropped because they were no longer profitable to their insurer.<br/>
None were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.<br/>
None of these guys report being interviewed by death panels.</p>

<p>A lot of people who do not now have coverage could pay $550 a month for coverage themselves.  Also, I'm sure my group of self-employed neighbors, all in their 50s and paying around 2K a month for insurance, would be glad to participate in such a program. </p>

				<p>Looks to me like the bill can't discriminate on that basis.  </p>

<p>They have to provide health care.  So why not opt out? Pay the fine and be happy and get health care anyhow.  Plus if I need heatlh insurance I just walk in and get it then.  </p>

<p>Posted by: leichtman<br/>
I was absolutely serious about my suggestion that all Rs and radical Is who oppose healthcare reform should be allowed the right to opt out of all coverage and when they choose to go bare and show up sick at their county hospital they should be denied treatment(unless they have cash or a credit card) no matter how ill they are. Furthermore, if they refuse coverage, have a catostrophic illness they can not pay for and somehow manage to get ER treatment they should then be denied Bankruptcy protection and be hounded by hospital bill collectors.</p>

				<p>From Kristof in the NYT:</p>

<p>"&#x201C;Decriminalization has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal,&#x201D; notes a report this year from the Cato Institute. It notes that drug use appears to be lower in Portugal than in most other European countries, and that Portuguese public opinion is strongly behind this approach.</p>

<p>A new United Nations study, World Drug Report 2009, commends the Portuguese experiment and urges countries to continue to pursue traffickers while largely avoiding imprisoning users. Instead, it suggests that users, particularly addicts, should get treatment.<br/>
Senator Webb has introduced legislation that would create a national commission to investigate criminal justice issues &#x2014; for such a commission may be the best way to depoliticize the issue and give feckless politicians the cover they need to institute changes.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There are only two possibilities here,&#x201D; Mr. Webb said in introducing his bill, noting that America imprisons so many more people than other countries. &#x201C;Either we have the most evil people on earth living in the United States, or we are doing something dramatically wrong in terms of how we approach the issue of criminal justice.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And decrim, coupled with taxation and regulation of MJ, could be an additional funding source for health care.</p>

<p>GAT, I like Webb as my early D for 2016.  I wish I could name an early R choice, but a fiscally conservative socially libertarian Indie like me sees the Rs drifting away, while the Ds are coming back on maintaining a strong military.  Webb and Sestak are our kind of Ds, but could have been our kind of Rs at one time.</p>

<p>Well, my point wasn't for the WaPo itself.  It was just for this political blog.  I do agree that the paper should be doing more investigative journalism (although this paper is still one of the best.  It was this paper that broke the East European renditions under Bush.)</p>

<p>Woodward and Bernstein were investigative journalists.  That's what they do.  Chris C isn't.  His niche is different.</p>

<p>I think the paper is relatively good about the nonsense news stuff.  It's really cable that seems to distort what's going on.</p>

				<p>Hi BWJ -I agree with you and want to add that I have responded to every email that suggests euthanasia and rationing by laying out the real debate points and debunking the phony ones.  I have copied my originator's mailing list.  I have made clear my own preferences, but segregated them from the body of the response, so the recipient could weigh my perspective.  I think we each have a responsibility to do that if we are better informed than our friends and clients who send us imaginary stuff. </p>

<p>To the poster pretending to be Jindal I will patiently say that I am on Medicare and thus am a 66 year old relying on the federal government for my health insurance.  Nothing about that changes with these bills. </p>

<p>For another take on this issue with which I agree, see:</p>

Thank goodness Woodward and Bernstein didn't follow that approach.  The Post used to be about speaking the truth to power.   Back in the Katherine Graham day.  Now in the Fred Hiatt era...Oh well.</p>

<p><br/>
Just as it's simply not journalism to report on a "controversy" about BHO's birth certificate, it's not okay to simply report on idiotic disinformation about health reform.  You can't "report" Joe Blow said yesterday that water isn't wet.  You have to push back--that's journalism.<br/></p>

<p>Well, if the media is not going to push back, it falls on Obama to do so.  It's not ideal, but it's reality.  The press is going to push what Palin and Limbaugh says.  Not what's in any bill.</p>

				<p>I disagree with the overall theme of the post.  </p>

<p>It shouldn't be totally on BHO to push back against the disinformation.  The media, including Fix as an employee of the national political paper of record, has a duty to refute--every day--the lies being told about the health care reforms.  These polls I'm seeing are absurd: the respondents have no knowledge base whatsoever regarding any of the health care reforms.  The little information they have, e.g., death panels, is the nonsense being pushed by Fox News, Big Pharma, and the organized hate community that opposes anything BHO is for.  BTW, does anyone think those domestic terrorists who show up at BHO events armed to the gills are looking to "debate" single payer or the public option?</p>

<p>Unless it's sneer-quoted I don't call these uh people "conservatives."  I remember when conservatism was a legitimate political outlook that I didn't agree with but could respect.  What we have now is neither legitimate nor deserving of respect.  Certainly not since they whatever you call them pushed for the legitimization of torture.

				<p>I'm guessing that Rs are just jealous that they didn't think up the program. Can you imagine how they would be busting a gut right now reminding voters how brilliant they were if the program was their's. Unfortunately these folks are pulling against American success. They are praying that the CFC failed and disappointed it didn't, that the stimulus fails, and that healthacre reform fails. What true blooded patriots they are. Heck their party leaders are even stating how if America fails the R party wins. Again the sick are not just Ds or poor Americans. Illness strikes us all Rs and Ds rich an poor,and its time we should all be working for healthcare reform and stop dreaming up ways to stop it. </p>

				<p>I was absolutely serious about my suggestion that all Rs and radical Is who oppose healthcare reform should be allowed the right to opt out of all coverage and when they choose to go bare and show up sick at their county hospital they should be denied treatment(unless they have cash or a credit card) no matter how ill they are. Furthermore, if they refuse coverage, have a catostrophic illness they can not pay for and somehow manage to get ER treatment they should then be denied Bankruptcy protection and be hounded by hospital bill collectors.</p>

				<p>nusereporter should check out how wildly succesful the CFC program has been before he post his hate government drivel:</p>

<p> U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Thursday that after a wildly successful run, the cash for clunkers program will come to a close on Monday, August 24th at 8 p.m. EDT. </p>

<p>"This program has been a lifeline to the automobile industry, jump starting a major sector of the economy and putting people back to work," Secretary LaHood said. "At the same time, we&#x2019;ve been able to take old, polluting cars off the road and help consumers purchase fuel efficient vehicles." </p>

One pont that no one seems to hear is how our current healthcare system makes our corporations uncompetitve in the international markets. That is capitalism at its worst. Seems like all good patriotic Americans should be pulling for this to work. And for those clammering we are going too fast, do you not understand that FDR was having a similar debate about healthcare in 1932; 77 years ago. Isn't that long enough?</p>

				<p>When the majority of Republicans think Obama is a Manchurian candidate plot that started unleashed in early 1960s Kenya to turn the US into a socialist Muslim state, misinformation has become patriotic amongst a sorry fraction of our populace.  </p>

<p>It is as hard to combat that as it is a raging flu epidemic.  You just have to wait for the disgusting virus of rightwing radio disinfo to blow over and for health and sanity to return to the population.

				<p>My fear with the Govt. management of any element of health care has to do with politics, regardless of which party is in office.  Politicians greatest concern is votes, followed closely by campaign contributions use to get more votes.  The result is that once a national program is in place with million of beneficiaries, it will only grow as whomever is in office seeks favor with some new batch of potential voters.  One result is that strategic decisions about the future course of a program are political - and not always the best for the long term.  <br/>
For example, Social Security would likely be declared a Ponzi scheme if it were run by a corporation.  Taking in money today to pay benefits accrued and promised years ago.  It got this way because of politics.  And SS is refered to as a "third rail"  Just trying to touch it can result in political death.  A national health program, somehow supported by tax payer dollars WILL end up the same way.  Probably not in the possible 7 years the current administration has but it is inevitable.<br/>
The other challenge is the public option or partial public option or whatever we might end up with.  My private insurance premium runs about 15% of my pay - with me paying 100% of any annual increases.  If I were even lower paid, the percentage would rise to perhaps as much as 20%.  This seems like a clear case of where the employer would dump the private plan and pay a percentage as yet another Govt. quasi-tax.  Where would this leave me?  Either pay all my own med. bills or be swallowed up by a mind numbing federal bureaucracy.<br/>
The current examples of how that might turn out include the Cash for Clunker program.  Claims for FIXED amounts of money authorized by a very distinct set of FIXED rules for very specific services are far behind in being paid for a finite number of cars.  <br/>
I can only imagine the staggering bureaucracy that will be built to process a limitless number of claims with almost an infinite number of variations.  I CAN imagine healthcare capturing 40 or 50 percent of GDP, esp. if the government ends up "running" major portions of it. </p>

				<p>Yes, their healthcare obligations suddenly changed. They are no longer on the hook for unlimited no-co-pay insurance for all those retirees. The union got a fixed amount in a fund to administer for the retirees, and the company is off the hook. Weren't you paying attention? That's what a bankruptcy DOES.</p>

<p>I get it. You wanted them all to fail. And you want lower unemployment. Oh, and no illegals. Here's my suggestion: try being a migrant farm worker for a while, and come back and tell us how you liked it.</p>

<p>And while you're looking for this new place to surf you might mosey over to google.com and find out just what percentage of the cost of a car goes to labor.  It might be an eye-opening revelation (though I suspect you'll ignore it).  </p>

<p>As for making cars, why don't we just turn into a country that makes all its money by investing in investments that invest in investments.  You know, "financial instruments."  Let the Chinese make everything, let the Indians do all the phone and IT work, and we'll manufacture elegant financial bullsh*t.  </p>

				<p>It is laughable the way people condemn the administration for "taking over" GM. There were 3 options:</p>

<p>1) Let it fail on it's own. (Bankruptcy)<br/>
2) Keep loaning it money without strings.<br/>
3) Make bridge loans with strings; help GM get through bankruptcy quickly.</p>

<p>In my book, #3 was the best option. What's your pick?</p>

				<p>It is laughable the way people condemn the administration for "taking over" GM. There were 3 options:</p>

<p>1) Let it fail on it's own. (Bankruptcy)<br/>
2) Keep loaning it money without strings.<br/>
3) Make bridge loans with strings; help GM get through bankruptcy quickly.</p>

<p>In my book, #3 was the best option. What's your pick?</p>

<p>The same people complaining about government takeovers are also complaining about unemployment. Unemployment would have been much higher if the government had not guided GM through bankruptcy.</p>

				<p>I watched the last part of Obama's OFA Q&amp;A. Of course, the questions were pretty friendly, but it was obvious that Obama has a great mastery of the facts, and can think and talk on his feet.</p>

<p>Did you see the Clinton / Bush I debates in 1992?  Clinton was *stunning*.  Not only did he have an extraordinary amount of detail at his fingertips but he could compose the answer to a second question in his head while engaged in giving a detailed answer to the first.  I have never seen a more organized mind, not ever, not anywhere.  </p>

I agree that the reforms should not encourage employers to "dump" people onto the public plan. But that is better than dumping them onto no plan at all. </p>

<p>I like the idea of separating health insurance from employment. I worked at one company for 12 years after college, and then 3 companies in the 12 years since then. I was lucky to have maintained coverage for my family with each change--juggling doctor's appointments and starting from scratch on yearly deductibles was bad enough.</p>

<p>This is the problem. Cost shifting to the public option grows the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The public option is going to overwhelm health care, one way or another.</p>

<p>The more profit is wrung from the good risk pool just by making it smaller, the more money we spend in the public pool. </p>

				<p>@viz - Again, what stops that from happening now? Ironically, it's usually low paid workers who get the poorest benefits. Highly compensated employees also tend to have the best benefits packages. Companies who find a competitive advantage in providing insurance will continue to do so. There are companies that will drop coverage, but guess what? That's happening already.</p>

<p>Two sets of employers will benefit from reform. The first are companies who provide coverage currently, but compete against companies that don't. The bottom feeders just lost an 8% cost advantage. Second are companies who would want to provide coverage, but can't afford the full ride. An 8% fee combined with government subsidies for low earners will extend coverage to the working poor. Without going into details, I have faced these dilemmas as an employer myself.</p>

<p>We are (I think) agreed upon one point. What comes out of this should not encourage dumping of high cost employees onto a public plan. </p>

<p>By the way, thanks for turning off the caps lock. </p>

				<p>@Viz - You still don't get it. I am looking at it from the employer's perspective. Employers provide benefits such as insurance coverage to attract and retrain talented employees. By dropping coverage, an employer makes itself less attractive than competing employers in the same industry.</p>

<p>Right now, an employer can do exactly what you say and pay nothing. That's right zero, zip, nada. Under *some* of the proposals, if they did that, they'd pay 8% of payroll. The proposals thus make it less attractive to dump coverage. Q.E.D.</p>

Oh and I know your next retort before you even say it.  Its all employees or no employees?  Well here's how you get around that.  You seperate your employees by different tax ID numbers.  Low paid, high expense employees go in group A, high paid, lower expense employees in group B.</p>

				<p>@Viz - You still don't get it. I am looking at it from the employer's perspective. Employers provide benefits such as insurance coverage to attract and retrain talented employees. By dropping coverage, an employer makes itself less attractive than competing employers in the same industry.</p>

<p>Right now, an employer can do exactly what you say and pay nothing. That's right zero, zip, nada. Under *some* of the proposals, if they did that, they'd pay 8% of payroll. The proposals thus make it less attractive to dump coverage. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>By the way, turn off the all caps. I can hear you perfectly fine. Now if you'll just start making sense...</p>

				<p>We should clog the switchboards in Washington at 202-224-3121, with our anger and frustration, as this is the only thing our legislators seem to understand. Hundreds and thousands, perhaps millions have already bombarded the politicians who are pandering only to corporate welfare and not the 9.5 percent of jobless American workers. E-verify has literary risen from the grave because we have pressured the morons in the Capitol. We must neither let them weaken the NO-MATCH-LETTER or police enforcement 287 G, not whittle away at the lightening raids of ICE. However, we should adjoin rescinding the misinterpreted birthright citizenships or anchor babies. law.American workers have a significant roll to play in contacting ICE if they hear or see illegal activity in the workplace.</p>

<p>Read many undisclosed facts at the HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND NUMBERSUSA.  I anticipate this is a ominous beginning to set the American people up for another AMNESTY? The 1986 didn't work and was subject to massive corruption and fraud. What makes them think in  Congress, that this will not turn into a irreversible travesty. Illegal immigrants already receive free health care in emergency hospitals and already costing taxpayers billions--so they are not going to participate in a public option? We must remove the illegal immigrants from the workplace methodically and leave our nation, so American jobless can step into that niche?</p>

I'm sorry all an unscrupulous employer needs to do is find a way to justify an employee did something wrong to terminate their employment.  Don't fool yourself, it can and I'm sure is done.</p>

It just meant that there are other things involved in reform and that there are other reforms involved.  That people with insurance will have no gain.</p>

<p>They get around it by laying a paper trail of "performance issues."  For some companies it's reflexive.  Every manager at Microsoft maintains an email folder of dirt on every one of his direct reports, and if he decides one day that he doesn't like someone's face he can produce a paper trail of "performance issues," which nobody can prove represents the ordinary foibles of challenging work.</p>

<p>I've heard dozens of testimonials on the radio from people who had superlative reviews at work until they came down with a medical condition and had even a brief hospitalization.  Then within weeks they're fired.</p>

				<p>It's worse than that.</p>

<p>Self-insured (large) employers can't just "dump" employees from their health insurance plan. They can, however, fire them for no reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>So you get too sick, you lose your job AND your health insurance. Nice. Under COBRA, they have to continue covering you for 18 months, if you pay 102% of the whole premium (including the employer contribution). If you're lucky enough to find a job, you now have a "pre-existing condition" not covered under the new insurance.</p>

<p>Fixing these things is important. It won't save any money, but it is only right.</p>

				<p>ag1976, I don't doubt that the insurance companies have similar panels that decide what is and is not covered.</p>

<p>But if, somehow, the care you've been denied by a private insurer were allowed by a public insurer, that would represent just more care that the public insurer would have to deny someone else.  Ultimately, in order to live up to Obama's cost promises, public panels would have to deny more care overall than private panels would.  There's just no way to get around the inefficiency of the government.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the various checks and balances.  A public death panel would be answerable to the people who appointed them, who can't be replaced quickly with their 2-6 year terms of office.  But if Blue Cross denies coverage in some outrageous way, they risk losing a lot of business immediately.</p>

<p>I'm sympathetic to the problems you've faced, which would be enormous under any health care system.  </p>

<p>Especially your "job lock."  You would face less trouble getting personal insurance if the Cold War model of getting health insurance through employers (i.e. the tax break) were scrapped.  Obama's not proposing to change that, because large employers benefit the most from it, and Obama is courting them for support.  You complained about the 'greed' of a private insurer, but please realize that you are also the victim of politicians' greed - that is, their distortion of the individual health insurance market which Obama is trying to distort more, and for the worse.</p>

<p>Even if you think the public death panels would somehow be more generous than the private ones, that is an argument that a "news" article should not merely dismiss out of hand, as Chris uncharacteristically did today.</p>

<p>i agree it'll even the playing field but who cares if they're covered under a public option or their employer sponsored plan.  its not like anyone's hiring nowadays anyway.  Or better yet employers will dump the OLD onto there.  They're the ones that are costing so much anyways.  I'll bet you'd have a certain group of large employers that would look to find their 5-10 highest claimants and dump, dump dump.</p>

<p>If you don't think it'd happen you're naive because their costs are much more than their premium especially in a situation where you're self-insured and you can easily find this info out and their costs aren't just their premium but their claims raise the rates for all within their company.</p>

<p>These democrats really need to think two to 3 steps ahead at least and they're not.  Some employers are already thinking of ways to game the new system even before its set.</p>

<p><br/>
Oh and I'm in NJ.  We had reform in 1994.  We have guaranteed issue but we DON'T have an individual mandate so that's all we'll get from it.  It'll bring our costs down to force all into the system but our insurers are already at an 85+% medical loss ratio that HR 3200 shows as a requirement.  In fact Horizon BCBS had a medical loss ratio of 88.2% in the most recent year data is available for.  </p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>

<p><br/>
are you serious?  When a public option or co-op or whatever you want to call it SETS reimbursement rates, doesn't pay premium taxes then SURE government is competitive.</p>

<p>Let's see a good example.  Say the USPS was subsidized to only charge $3 for overnight packages anywhere in the world and FedEx and UPS could only do it down to $12.  How long do you think it would take for EVERYONE to realize this and use the USPS and how long before the lines at the USPS were so ridiculously long you couldn't do anything.  How long before the costs blew up??</p>

<p>Seriously have a clue about what you're talking about before you speak.</p>

<p>A tame public option or co-op that had minimal government intervention, had to pay taxes like everyone else then i could deal with that.  That's what you have in Massachussetts.  </p>

<p>Option 1: cover employee on current group plan 75% of $15,000 in annual premium or $11,250 cost to employer.</p>

<p>Option 2: dump employee to public option and pay 8% of the employee's salary of $50,000 and pay $4000</p>

<p>You are clueless.  The so called death panels exist in one place and one place only, INSURANCE COMPANIES!  </p>

<p>I just got denied a surgery that will prevent me from getting serious infections that will cost my insurance company more in the long run.  Denied.  I pay my premiums every month.  I also am aware that if I can get them to approve my tonsils being removed, they will start to claim that the strep throat I average 4 times a year is a pre-existing condition and will cancel my policy and ask for me to repay any monies paid out.</p>

<p>I know this because I can't get private insurance.  I have to have a job that provides it.  Want to know why I can't private insurance?  This one is classic.</p>

<p>In October of 2006 I was kidnapped, assaulted, beaten and left for dead.  I now suffer post traumatic stress disorder and am on axiety medication for the rare times that I do something more than go to work or to my families.  I didn't do those things to myself, but I'll never be able to get private insurance.  I'll always have to have a job I hate just so I can get be covered. </p>

<p>This is what you and people like you don't want to see, that real Americans suffer every day because of greed.  And I'm a vet, but what little benefits I could get from the government wouldn't cover my PTSD as it was not service related.  But I still love my country and would gladly stand up and defend Her each and every day regardless of what lies were told to me when I enlisted.</p>

				<p>Some Republicans, in the partisan zeal and indifference toward helping ordinary people in the crucial area of health care, hope defeating a health care bill will be Obama's political "Waterloo." Unfortunately to use the Waterloo analogy, Obama as Wellington, has failed to show up on the battlefield against Napoleon, being content to merely give nice speeches in Brussels. </p>

<p>Obama, as Chris writes and I have been writing for at least a couple months, has not stated what must be in a health care bill, other than general principles, to be acceptable to him. He has seemed more obsessed with controlling health care costs , in his rhetoric until recently, than improving the quality of health care.</p>

<p>Obama is not able to convince most people to support his still undefined health care bill with a few simplistic Reaganesque statements. Most people probably know the bill is about a thousand pages long. Summarizing a bill of such length and complexity to a few general principles would be an insult to the intelligence of most people. </p>

<p>As to illegal immigrants, many will receive health care coverage and government subsidies, either through quasi employer or individual mandates. The federal government will not be taking over the health care system in this country, but will be greatly increasing its influence and regulation of health care in this country. There still seems legitimate issues as to whether an Obama/Democratic health care plan will deny some medical treatments to seriously ill persons. Misinformation and propaganda has been used by Democrats, as well as Republicans. Partisan politics as usual, at the expense of the well-being of tens of millions of ordinary people, not change anyone can truly believe in. </p>

<p>Please remind me today what color is the sky?  Blue, Green  or Red??</p>

<p>Unless you see a smoking gun in Ron Williams' hand you're doing nothing but fearmongering against insurance companies which makes you no better than the idiots calling Obama Hitler (YES I CALLED THEM IDIOTS).  I'm sure you've got a reason for hating them and that's fine but at least have some semblance of fact with it.</p>

				<p>shrink2, I hope you saw my comment where I agreed I over stated the teaching hospital statement.</p>

<p>On these Death Panels, we already have them.  Everyday committees decide who will get the next heart or kidney - sometimes a young person or older person dies because the committee decided that they were just too sick to give them the heart.</p>

<p>And of course we have the real Death Panels.  Every day people in this country die from colon cancer because they could not afford the screening.  When people die because they cannot afford healthcare you in effect are telling them - if you cannot afford insurance then you are sentenced to an early death.  The real Death Panel is the Republican Party</p>

<p>Why are these obvious responses not being put out there by Obama's team?</p>

				<p>What does the buildup to the Iraq war and the debate over Health Care Reform have in common?  In both, the right wing's arguments have been based on misinformation and lies.  In the drumbeat to go to war with Iraq we were told about dangerous weapons of mass destruction, about close connections between Iraq and Al Qaida. In the health care debate it is "Death Panels" and god knows what else yet to come.  </p>

<p>Gullibility and timidity are always a bad combination. Republicans know this and play it to their best advantage.  Anything to get their way, say anything to protect the profits of Insurance giants.  Americans deserve the governemnt they get, but let's not fall prey again to right wing lies and obfuscations.</p>

This gigantic drop has happened despite the fact that he's had the entire US Main Stream Media cheerleading his parade, running cover for him, and censoring all news that could damage him politically. And despite the fact that his support from his black racist tribal members has never wavered, and never will no matter what he'll do. They'll support him even if he governs like Idi Amin.

				<p>Mark,</p>

<p>I am wanting to respond to your post with a link, but I cannot because history has been rewritten.  Apparently Hutchison supporters posted a bogus summary of the events of her criminal trial and everyone else is just repeating it.</p>

<p>Check the archives for the Stateman and you will see the facts.  Judge Onion issued a ruling which Earle felt would kill his case.  Earle announced ready.  He then participated in the picking of a jury.  When Judge Onion asked that he call his first witness Earle refused.  This is when he ordered a directed verdict.</p>

<p>The guy who runs the Quorum report there in Austin knows the story behind the story.  </p>

<p>He long with myself accidently gave Ray Hutchison documents which show Earle illegally used 100k to help Ann Richards against Clayton Williams.  Ray went to Earle with the documents and Earle removed the DA assigned to Hutchison's case and then allowed for the dismissal of the case by only asking for a continuance after the jury was sworn - which we both know is when double jeapordy attaches.</p>

<p>The questions is - will Perry use this against her?</p>

<p>The Dems will not because it implicates Richards and Earle.  The Republicans in Austin are waiting to see what happens.  They all know if Perry goes with the story Hutchison will respond in kind.</p>

<p>They could just self destruct.  My sources in Austin are telling me key power centers in the Republican party are demanding restraint by both sides.  </p>

Instead he is trying to run the country the way you would in an ideal world. It is not an ideal world and the Republicans show no signs of wanting to do anything but get 41 senators in 2010.

There's work for [illegal aliens] because we have industries, agriculture chief among them, that depend on a helpless underclass to pay lower wages than they would be required to pay to citizens. They are not tangential to our ugly version of capitalism, they are intrinsic to it.</p>

<p>So true.  And from the perspective of their employers' greed, the most advantageous aspect of all may well be that these illegal alien workers dare not complain about any wrongs committed against them, lest their illegal status come to the authorities' attention and they be deported.

<p>READ THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN. It specifically prohbits and penalizes companies for doing that. Incidentally you seem to want to defend insurance companies without bothering to mention that our Vets are on that dreaded government plan.

<p>The NBC link merely mentions that unnamed fact-checkers claim there will be no death panels.  It doesn't say how they would know, with this fictitious bill Obama wants.</p>

<p>The AP link merely refutes the loony right-wing argument that the new gov't system would "require" some form of "counseling" of people nearing the end of their lives that would supposedly encourage "euthanasia."  </p>

<p>But NONE of that disproves the central complaint about "Death Panels."</p>

<p>We are all likely to die earlier as a result of these disasters that are the current health care proposals out there.  </p>

<p>Almost all of them require the government to take a larger role in health care, ultimately meaning the government will decide, through regulations, reviews, appointees, or committees, who can get what kind of care and when.  It is entirely fair to refer to this decision mechanism as a "panel."</p>

<p>We know that Obama has claimed to "bend the cost curve" downward, i.e. reduce costs, however slightly.</p>

<p>And we know that the government can't run anything efficiently (see the center-left Pearlstein column of yesterday).  So for an increasingly inefficient system to reduce its costs, it must lower the quality of care SUBSTANTIALLY.  This lower-quality care will ultimately lead to lower life expectancies than under the status quo.</p>

<p>And there you have it.  The government's "panel" will lead to millions of premature "deaths," and thus the term "Death Panel" is histrionic, but substantial.</p>

<p>Obama on the campaign trail, with brow in full furrow, was annoyed at those who didn't like his reform plans, saying that if you have health insurance that you like the only difference will be that your premium will be lower.  I heard it right from his mouth.</p>

<p>We now know that was a Big Lie - your taxes will have to go up to cover the $1T to $2T in new costs, and your insurance company will be forced to RAISE its rates to cover Obama's favorite new coverage provisions, and all that only applies IF your employer decides to continue offering this increasingly expensive health insurance plan.</p>

<p>I'm very disappointed that Chris C. waved off an entire side of the argument, when he is normally even-handed.</p>

<p>Illegal aliens are here because there's work for them.

<p>They are also the most deprived and helpless people in our society and to try to score points on them is frankly despicable.  Why don't you go after women with breast cancer while you're at it.  Or children with leukemia.  Ugh.</p>

wait you don't think employers in many Norhteastern states for example will dump people onto a public plan at an 8% payroll tax?  Let me do some quick math.</p>

<p>Employer sponsored insurance plan cost for family: $15000 a year (and that's LOW).  If the employer pays 75% of that it amounts to $11,250.  </p>

<p>If that employee makes $50,000 a year then the tax is $4,000.</p>

<p>Which would YOU rather pay $11250 or $4000?</p>

<p>Please help me with where the math doesn't compute.</p>

<p>The dumping won't go on everywhere but they need to regionally account for this percentage of penalty and they don't seem to be doing that yet.  They had better get it right becuase employers are just begging to dump the low paid and sick onto a public option.</p>

<p>Bobby, now that you said it twice, what is your problem with teaching hospitals? We all got taught somewhere. For me, lucky, that I am, it was in Harvard's system. I thought hospitals like Beth Israel, Mass General, Brigham and Womens, etc. were the best place to learn in the world, no joke. It is true that if you are hospitalized in such a place, you will be seen and examined by a whole lot more people than in an all about profit "doctor's hospital". Is it your impression that teaching hospitals make more mistakes?<br/></p>

				<p>Andyr3, okay you are correct and I broke a golden rule - never paint with a broad brush - </p>

<p>but I have used VA hospitals in several states and in every case the quality of care was bad, real bad.</p>

<p>It took doctors at two VA hospitals 11 years to diagnose a simple problem which now has me nearly totally disabled.  I cannot drive long distances. I cannot sit or stand or laydown for more than a few minutes - the pain is horrific - nothing is working.  On Septemner 1st I have what is known as a caudal racz procedure scheduled.</p>

<p>Even now after 11 years of seeing doctors in training supervised by university staff who do not care, they still got it wrong when a radiologist in training misread an MRI.  Only upon my insistance that I see a neurologist did I finally get a correct diagnosis.  Even then the neurologist in training went with the bad MRI report and did nothing until the Chief medical officer intervened and chose to send me to a pain management person with 32 years  experience.  He checked the actual MRI film and  found the problem.</p>

<p>11 years it took for the VA to allow me to see someone other than a doctor in training - I nearly drowned Memorial Day weekend when I lost my legs and two men had to swim out and pull me from the Gulf.</p>

<p>But Andy you are correct, I should have limited the statement to my experience in several VA.'s  And yes there are numerous good teaching hospitals.  If I had the money I would go to any of the teaching hospitals you listed</p>

<p>And to be fair to the VA - the dental clinic in San Antonio is great - why? - because the guy in charge does not allow the dentists in training to run the show.</p>

<p>wow silly me.  I didn't think 3-4% was huge and also its not guaranteed.  The only thing guaranteed is our taxes will continue to grow with all the added entitlements with this administration.  Oh and the debt will grow too.  oh and the unemployment.</p>

<p>YAY DEMOCRATS!!!</p>

<p>oh and before you reply please let me know when it stops being Bush's fault?  When the economy has totally bottomed out where it can't go any lower???  Ya nice job Mr President stopping us from going over a cliff but the problem is you keep dangling us over that same cliff.  Ya I know its only been 8 month's he's been in office.  IN two years the same retort you'll give is "He's only been in office give him more time".</p>

<p>In 6 years time, "He's only been in office 6 years, we need to amend the constitution to allow a third term".  How far into his second term will we hear that???</p>

				<p>Here's why there'll be no healthcare reform: Republicans don't want it. They are making far too much money for the current system.</p>

<p>Speaking on Fox News last night, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) claimed that health care reform should not happen because it doesn&#x2019;t enjoy &#x201C;bipartisan&#x201D; support, adding that a bill cannot be bipartisan unless it garners &#x201C;somewhere between 75 and 80 votes.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>Hatch is hardly the only conservative senator to float a 75-80 vote supermajority requirement for health reform.  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who is currently blocking attempts to fix the health care system, told the Washington Post that &#x201C;[w]e ought to be focusing on getting 80 votes.&#x201D; Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY) demanded &#x201C;a bill that 75 or 80 senators can support.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course when it's somethey they want -- different story. Biggest hypocrites in the world.</p>

<p>' Subsidies For Drug Companies: In November 2003, the Senate passed a prescription drug plan for seniors that was strongly backed by lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry with only 54 votes.  Nevertheless, Grassley released a statement praising himself as the &#x201C;lead Senate architect of the bipartisan legislation&#x201D; creating this plan.'</p>

FIGHT BACK with repetition. The opposition have people on FOX (Entertainment) News repeating these myths over and over again. Where is the repetition about the truth over and over again?</p>

<p>Calling the Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC and any other form of mediat that would like to keep any credibility to speak the truth over and over again. Not just in one news report or new article.  My suggestion would be to have a truth segment about healthcare on a daily basis.</p>

				<p>The government studies show that Medicare Advantage does not deliver any better care than regular Medicare.</p>

<p>This was one of Bush's great ideas to push towards privatization of Medicare.  The government keeps all the liability, and the private insurance companies get money for administration. Not care--administration.</p>

				<p>Bobby, I agree. Co-located services [including mental health, many people who can not tolerate the idea of getting mental health care for themselves feel terrible but somatize their complaints, then populate the waiting rooms of ERs and doctors' offices] are the most obvious way to integrate services. This would greatly improve access and outcomes, which of course, drives efficiency.</p>

<p>Problem is, the silos. Fee for service silos provide direct incentives for the dis-integration of services. </p>

				<p>shrink2, I am not saying you are wrong on the savings issue - I personally favor allowing the States to opt out of the National system if they have their own reform.  This allows for more experimentation on a variety of models which would be a good thing.</p>

<p>The VA clinic in Harlingen I think would qualify as an integrated clinic.  I am no defender of the VA system - teaching hospitals will always produce second rate care - but our clinic is only experienced doctors and specialists.</p>

<p>This model for the delivery of healthcare is awsome.  Every speciality you can imagine, lab, MRI everything - and soon a day surgery facility.  I wish we had more  clinics like this all over the country.</p>

<p>Maybe Obama cannot get everything he wants on the public option, but what he can do which the republicans would have to support is extend the public healthcare to all veterans.</p>

<p>Not all veterans get free healthcare at the VA.  Obama needs to support a veterans insurance option wherein those who do not get free care from the VA can buy VA insurance from the VA which will then provide them free VA healthcare - can you see the Republicans opposing this?</p>

<p>I guess my bigger point is, rational debate and discussion is always good - unfortunately mostly the rightwing, but some on the left also are making an intellegent debate nearly impossible.</p>

				<p>It figures that Bozo Obama shill Chris Cillizza would describe any opposition to Obama's Socialist Health Care Bill as "misinformation". Like the rest of the Democrap Socialist Party--controlled Main Stream Media, Chris C. is doing his part to censor anything the Obama administration does that would do political damage to his/their facist little tin foil god Obama, even if that means a Hitler--like Socialist government--uber--alles state--control over our health care system. The German people once loved Hitlers health care system also because it provided what they thought was free health care--just like mommy and daddy used to do. What they learned the hard way was that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't. Freebees always have strings attached. The one thing all facist, Communist, Socialist--run governments have in common is very good  health care, AND IT'S FREE!! You might have to wait a couple of years for it, but when you do get it (assuming that it's approved by a panel, and you're not dead), it wont cost you a dime. The way Obama and the Democrap Socialists are governing so far, there may not be a presidential election in 2012. Hugo Chavez is doing that now in Venezuela, and it looks like Obama and the Democrap Socialists are following in his footsteps.</p>

				<p>Candygram for Mongo:</p>

<p>The stimulus plan is putting people back to work. Note that GM and others are bringing back workers because demand for cars is up (due to cash-for-clunkers, a part of the stimulus plan.)  The banks are much more careful with their loans now, so people aren't getting cars they can't afford.  Same with mortgages, only moreso.</p>

<p>If you don't want people building more cars and houses, where are these jobs supposed to come from? And be serious, if Obama wanted to spend more money to employ more people, you'd be against that too.  </p>

<p>If you don't think the Government can run Medicare, just ask anyone on the program if they want to go off Medicare and get private insurance--they won't.</p>

				<p>mark, I read that column and I have so many problems with it, I don't have time to send it up. </p>

<p>But I can find no sign of movement away from the current models, I see expansion of the current models. If you can find who is going to lose money doing what they are currently doing in any of the bills being discussed, I would love to know about it. </p>

<p>BTW, I researched your "rural monopoly" argument and I found nothing to contradict you. It was really interesting doing that and it revised some of the things I thought about the history of Jim Crow. Thank you.</p>

<p>So I am not saying you are wrong, I just see no sign of winners and losers in the reform effort and common sense tells us that a system with out of control costs can not be fixed unless a lot of people who are making money the wrong way can't do that anymore. </p>

				<p>How's this for "misinformation"?</p>

<p>President Obama claims pediatricians do tonsillectomies for profit, but pediatricians do not do surgery. He claims that surgeons get paid $30,000 to $50,000 immediately for amputating a foot, when Medicare actually pays between $700 and $1200, including follow up care for 90 days. Most insurance companies are tied close to the Medicare rate, and payment in either case can take months.</p>

<p>Hard to complain about others getting facts wrong when he is so far off base himself--but the media rarely calls him on his misinformation.</p>

				<p>What is happening is more than mere disinformation - it is an outright coup by the rightwing and many Republicans.  But first, yesterday on Rush he remained silent and chose not to correct the caller when this alleged veteran claimed that if Obama Healthcare reform passes the government will take over the VA hospitals.</p>

<p>This is intentional fear mongering to manipulate scared seniors.</p>

<p>Here in Texas both of our US Senators Cornyn and Hutchison have blocked Obama from going forward with nominations of US Attorneys or federal judges.  They have stated that they will not honor the constitution by allowing the president to make his appointments.  They have stated Obama must get their permission before making any nominations.  </p>

<p>Part two - the radicalright cost the Republicans the election.  the American people and rightfully so fear them.  This is the second time they are using these tactics to undermind the democratic process - remember immigration reform?</p>

<p>If Obama and the Dems fail to stop these people then they should all resign.  They won - now they must do their job and represent the people who voted for them.</p>

<p>As to Cornyn and Hutchison it is time for Obama to make his nominations and take it to the Senate - If Cornyn wants to play this game and try and stop the nominations in the Senate Judiciary Committee then maybe Obama needs to show a pair and sue Cornyn in federal court to enforce his constitutional obligation to make these appointments.  If Obama allows Cornyn to win on this issue, then he is too weak to be president.</p>

				<p>If we let the government run our healthcare it will be another failure. They can&#x2019;t run Medicare now and you want them to run everyone&#x2019;s healthcare? That is so silly. This is nothing but another power grab by the Obama Administration. Just like the reports of a media consulting firm with ties to White House senior strategist David Axelrod has been hired to produce a multi-million dollar ad campaign touting the Obama administration's health care overhaul. How much corruption are we going to let happen before we stop it? Just like the Cash for Clunkers bill, how is getting Americans to turn in cars that are paid off and working fine helping Americans bottom line? This program is going to do the same thing as it did in the mortgage crisis and get people who can&#x2019;t afford to buy something making payments that they were not making before.<br/>
This is the same thinking and policy making that decided that after a mortgage mess that the thing to do is offer people 8K to buy houses. How is that going to help? You are just tempting people to buy things that they can&#x2019;t afford. Isn&#x2019;t this how our economy got in this predicament anyway? We need to elect leaders that can make decisions and write legislation that makes since. Not dream up a cockamamie scam to stimulate the economy, not wreck it. It is time to elect leaders that have brains and that are not under the thumb of special interest and lobbyist. By the way, ask yourself this question..Why isn&#x2019;t the Obama administrations putting the same effort that they are putting into the healthcare take over to putting Americans back to work? He did promise that he would do that. What is more important to you?</p>

				<p>What I don't get is why we aren't talking about funding a single-payer system the same way we fund SS &amp; Medicare?  Formulate a percentage of wages that is to be withheld from the employee and then have a corresponding employer match.  With family plans running $15K+ per year, there would have to be savings to the employer in a system like this so why would employers not support it?  They would reduce their employee benefits expense.</p>

<p>Yes exactly right. But where is this discussion happening? Only here I suspect.<br/>
In the main, most people are discussing stuff like death panels and other distractions.</p>

<p>The problem with eliminating perverse incentives (usually these are cost shifts to the taxpayer) is that you have tell people who are making a lot of money doing that: those days are over. It looks to me as if, in order to get a bill passed, they are building a "reform" effort that promises everything to everybody.   <br/></p>

				<p>@shrink2: Your comments make the assumption that there is no savings in having health care reform such as people NOT going into the emergency room every time they feel ill, preventative care being cheaper than treating someone who has become seriously ill, more money in the pockets of the middle class to spend and generate tax revenue and the weight of supplying high cost health care insurance from small businesses being relieved encouraging businesses to open shop, more jobs, more tax revenue.</p>

<p>The alternative is rising premiums, more bankruptcies, more foreclosures.</p>

				<p>MikeInMidland, I really appreciated that 11.06A post; thanks for the clarity.</p>

<p>bsimon, like you I favor moving away from "employer based" on competitive grounds.  There remains after the restructuring of GM the problem that they are facing huge health insurance costs that VW does not face.  </p>

<p>There has been some leveling of the field because of the productivity of American labor, which led Honda and Toyota and Subaru and BMW to open American factories, where they are presumably paying for employee health care.  </p>

<p>However I am sure that many American employers cannot make up the 16% cost factor, in comparison with the rest of the of the industrialized world, period. </p>

<p>That problem does not require a national single payer to address.  Assuming raw costs were controlled by the means we have often discussed, then regulating carriers, mandating coverage, and offering individual subsidies where necessary would be another method.  Either way would work if we first had efficient delivery in place, IMO.  <br/>

I see the coop idea working best with integrated clinics like the ones that were in the news last week, rather than as simple buying co-ops.  There have been several articles on the efficiencies of integrated clinic care in the WaPo and the NYT in the past week.  Did anyone pick up on Herbert's column about fed funded clinics in VT?  One of the bills expands on them.  I hope that feature remains.  </p>

				<p>Well, yes, Nosey, that's kinda my point. But I think it is incumbent upon both reporters as well as pundits to point this out more forcefully, and not make it so one-sided against Obama. Why aren't they strenuously pointing out that they are attascking and criticizing a plan that doesn't exist?</p>

<p>I just don't think the media has covered all this town hall nonsense remotely well.</p>

Senator Grassley is not interested in compromise, in spite of what he proclaims.  When Republicans in the house can applaud the fact that not a single Repblican voted for the stimulus plan even though the Democrats made significant concenssion to the conservative side, then we know that this debate is about political calculus and not what is best for the country.</p>

				<p>bsimon1: Well analyzed, particulary the Hamilton reference.</p>

<p>I wish it were as simple as deciding whether health care is a right of every citizen or simpley a consumer good/product.  </p>

<p>If the former, the government could just expand Medicare to cover everyone and let the insurance companies compete in the remaining space.  Increase Medicare withholding to fund the entire population and run it as a single payer system.  Every one gets all the basic medical services that Medicare funds and can still take out supplemental insurance if they want anything above that.</p>

<p>If the latter, the government should scrap Medicare, Medicaid, the Veteran's Administration, and any other government run program that provides health care to any segment of the population, including any requirement for employers to provide coverage.  That would likely generate any number of cooperatives sponsored by traditional insurers, labor unions, non-profit groups or other parties that would over time likely compete down to half a dozen big groups in much the same way that the cellular phone market has reduced itself to just a few major players.</p>

<p>It is not and will not be that cut and dried, though.  Most politicians try to please as many people as possible (or at least the ones who give them the most campaign contributions or votes), which is why our legislative processes produce some unwieldly muddles.</p>

<p>Here's hoping we all stay very healthy and never need any of this.</p>

				<p>Re: Public option as extended Medicare.</p>

<p>Yes, Medicare is underfunded. That's precisely because the costs for caring for the elderly are skyrocketing but their payments are not. This is an extension of Social Security, don't forget.</p>

<p>A public option would not subsidize care for the non-elderly in the same way. The point is to be competitive with private insurance, and should be self-supporting with premiums.</p>

<p>I've been guilty of calling it "Medicare for the rest of us," but that's not accurate. Besides being self-supporting, the pool of clients is not a high-cost group, like seniors.</p>

				<p>There should be two fundamental principals. Extending health care coverage to all and reducing the growth in health care spending. Given that the government spends half the health care dollars out there, it does have the ability to fundamentally reform the health care system. Whether or not the currently uninsured are covered by private insurance or a public plan or even a coop is beside the point.<br/><br/>
There is one bit of mis/dis-information that has a lot of truth to it. Under our system, anyone in the U.S. receives emergency medical care if they need it. Whether they are here on vacation (though there is vacation insurance for that), entered illegally, or overstayed a visa. Health care reform does little or nothing to address that one way or another. </p>

<p>Before the conservatives get all huffy, that's also true of Americans traveling abroad. My parents were in Costa Rica for my wedding when my father fell ill (a nose bleed that wouldn't stop). He was treated at minimal cost. He also got treated better in CR than in Texas where they stopped on their way back. I would argue strongly that an employer mandate will help to cover some of these costs.</p>

				<p>Random thoughts on healthcare reform:</p>

<p>My longheld support for a public option is driven by the need to expand affordable coverage &amp; sever the defacto sourcing of healthcare from one's employer.  The plans in proposal now seem to address the former, while making the latter problem worse.  If the final bill can begin addressing the rate of medical cost inflation, I'll accept it as a step in the correct direction, but would still prefer that basic health insurance be independant from employment.  </p>

<p>Thought two is that the Dems have strategized poorly.  What I recall from history class is that Hamilton was the proponent of arguing for the extreme, in order to move the final compromise toward your actual preferred solution.  The Dems don't seem to get this strategy, and instead remove the extremes from the table at the outset.  The GOP on the other hand seems to understand this strategy perfectly and has been far more successful at influencing the compromise than their numbers in Congress would otherwise imply.  <br/></p>

				<p>TwoCentsWrth describes the Prez's vision of the plan - unsubsidized and maintained on a fair playing field.</p>

<p>However, many of you are arguing for expanded Medicare/Medicaid, which is subject to the objections I posted at 7:10A.  I am now a happy recipient of Medicare.  I am seduced by it, even though I know it is underfunded by a disastrous lack of reserves.  To be clear, that lack of reserves is a product of Congressional failures and of the rise in aggregate medical costs at 3x-4x inflation, not being met by higher taxes to offset it.  </p>

<p>It is not a product of internal mismanagement of Medicare.</p>

<p>Thus it is not inconsistent to favor Medicare for internal efficiency while damning it as a black hole.  The solution for Medicare is to properly fund it while attacking aggregate medical costs [not insurance costs, rather care costs].  It is not a solution to dismantle it.  </p>

<p>So when you post in favor of public option - do you mean subsidized, like Medicare, or self-sustaning, like BHO and TwoCnts?</p>

				<p>The fear mongering that Senator Jon Kyl is using is that same old tactic used countless times before by both sides of the aisle everytime it looks like the party that holds the White House will get what looks like a public relations victory.</p>

<p>A public health care option is not going to put the private insurers out of business.  That same fear was expressed, for instance, when The Tennessee Valley Authority was given a license to produce and sell electric power.  The government agency selling electric power?  Private utilities won&#x2019;t be able to compete with that!  Well, that never happened.  Private utilizes have been able to compete with TVA just fine, and TVA has kept them more or less honest in their pricing of electric rates.  The fact is that the TVA does not use (is not allowed to use) taxpayer dollars to subsidize it&#x2019;s efforts in producing and selling electricity.  The power production part of TVA&#x2019;s operations is required to be self-supporting with sales of electricity.  The same should be true of a public health insurance option.<br/></p>

				<p>The anger of the anti-Obama crowd may be fueled in part by their perception that no one is really in charge of the Republican Party at the moment and they've decided to take matters into their own hands.  Yes, there are Republicans in Congress in opposition, but none of them appear to be the titular head of the party and the "official" head of the party, Michael Steele, doesn't seem to have the control of the party machinery that Howard Dean did for the Democrats.</p>

<p>Given that, it's not surprising that frustrated Republicans, libertarians, social conservatives, etc., who feel that no one really speaks for them are gathering together for public protests. And their frustration and aversion to [insert Obama, liberals, big government, taxes, or other trigger here] make them  receptive to any anti-Obama information regardless of whether or not it's true.</p>

<p>Democrats were in a similar state after Republicans successfully ran Tom Daschle out of the Senate, but fortunately for them Howard Dean didn't panic like a lot of the rest of them and successfully steered the party back to power, albeit with a lot of unintentional help from the Bush administration.</p>

<p>The opposition gets a lot of traction from the lack of a single, specific plan.  Once Congress gets down to individual House and Senate plans and later a single negotiated plan it will be harder to try to kill it through fear, uncertainty and doubt.</p>

				<p>Club for Growth, every time they open their mouths another voter in Pennsylvania gives Specter and Sestak a loving look!  They will be the millstone around Toomey's neck.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the article about Senator Kennedy.  A book I read described a late middle-aged sister seeing her late middle-aged brother for the first time in a few years.  She asks herself "When did my brother become a pink-cheeked, fluffy-haired old man?" That description comes to mind whenevr I see my old father, and look, there's Kennedy, who my father hates :)</p>

				<p>It isn't "misinformation," Chris.  It is disinformation.  To be misinformed implies some inadvertence.  The lies spread about health care reform have concocted quite deliberately by the enemies of reform, and spread via front organizations among those too willfully ignorant to bother ever to look anything up for themselves.</p>

<p>Their opinions do not deserve respect.  They need to be treated with the dismissiveness that they have so richly earned.  I was most pleased to see Barney Frank do so yesterday, and I sincerely hope that it is the start of a trend.</p>

				<p>Trep1 is absolutely right.  For a 'liberal' media they sure have done a very bad job at calling out the absolute lies about death panels, etc.</p>

<p>MGD1 - if Medicare/Medicaid are such 'disasters' I'd suggest that those folks go out and get private insurance.</p>

<p>They are currently free to do exactly that.</p>

				<p>The term is DISinformation -- propaganda aimed at subverting democracy...</p>

<p>AN AMERICAN POLITICIDE HIDES IN PLAIN SIGHT...</p>

<p>ENABLED BY THE NAIVETE OF ITS VICTIMS -- AMONG THEM, TEAM OBAMA.</p>

<p>&#x2022;  High time to restore civil and human rights by dismantling the secretive, multi-agency Bush-Cheney era extrajudicial "vigilante injustice network."</p>

<p><br/>
President Obama has been co-opted into becoming the spokesman and enabler of a federally-funded and overseen "multi-agency coordinated action" program of extrajudicial targeting and inhumane high-tech punishment...</p>

<p>...misusing federally-funded volunteer organizations and secret weapons programs to subvert the rule of law. </p>

<p>This nationwide, federal-local apparatus has deployed a civilian vigilante army that covertly places GPS tracking devices to stalk, persecute, vandalize and harass many thousands of unjustly targeted citizens and their families...</p>

<p>...reportedly, even when they seek medical treatment at health care facilities.</p>

<p>"The program" also misuses government surveillance operations to censor, and maliciously tamper with, the telecommunications of many thousands of the unjustly targeted -- and, victims maintain, funnels surveillance data to citizen "gang stalker" harassers.</p>

<p>An array of "programs of personal financial destruction" decimates the finances of "target" families. </p>

<p>And microwave / laser "directed energy weapons" are deployed to degrade their health, inducing illness, even  "slow-kill" death -- a gross violation of human rights, government-enabled crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>And no authorities will investigate -- invoking the "Gulag" tactic of dismissing those who seek justice as "delusional."</p>

<p>Team Obama: Wake up and smell the police state that is co-opting your administration and destroying democracy and the rule of law at the grassroots.</p>

				<p>The talk about the deomcrats going it alone on the healthcare reform bill I think is more of a ploy to pressure Grassley, Snowe and Enzi to stay at the table and come up with a compromise.  If they walk away then that will give Harry Reid the firepower to protect the decision to go it alone.  </p>

<p>Reid knows that he will put some middle of the road democrats in a tough position (him for one) next election if he has to do that so he would prefer a bipartisan bill, but it by no means is a dealbreaker.  He will pass Healthcare reform in some form, that I guaranty.  </p>

				<p>"And, like it or not, it's hard to look at the NBC/WSJ numbers and conclude anything other than that the opponents of reform have run a more effective campaign against the bill than its supporters have run in its favor."  This quote explains the entire problem.  The so-called liberal media has allowed "misinformation" to be legitimized as a valid view point.  Instead of saying, for example, that "Death Panels" did not exist in the proposal, readers saw headlines saying that Palin (or pick your pol) rails against death panels, Democrats disagree.  It is not a matter of perspective. It is a matter of fact. To treat both sides of the debate as equal is wrong.  There are aspects about the Democratic position that can be fairly debated,e.g. the government role in reform and whether or not that is a good thing and why or why not. But the first three examples you provide CC, in my opinion, demonstrate the failure of the media to report responsibly.<br/>
In an effort to not repeat the mistakes of the Clinton attempt at health care reform, Obama has made a mistake by not taking a more active role in the process.  However, it is clear to just about anyone who has eyes and ears that the Republicans are not interested in giving the Democrats any legislative accomplishments.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the Dallas link.</p>

<p>While I would not condemn in mgd1's tone or extent, and would support a health care bill that did not block the path to aggregate cost reform, I think that posing Medicare as a model and touting its low admin costs is ironic, considering that Medicare's unfunded liability is a threat to the future economic viability of the nation. A private insurer that lowered cost by stripping reserves would be placed in receivership.  I suggest that all of you who think that a "public option" is a panacea approach Pearlstein's most recent article with an open mind.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/18/AR2009081803449.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/18/AR2009081803449.html</a></p>

<p>Pearlstein does point out the cost savers that are in the bills [there are some good ones] and those that are not [there are many that ought to be] in an even-handed way, and like him, I am not trashing the effort or the bills.  I am simply criticizing the public option and its supposed benefits.  </p>

<p>I have the additional "fear" that a public option, which theoretically could be a neutral factor that did no harm in practice would become a seduction like Medicare - a bureaucratically well run system totally underfunded by Congress so that over time its unfunded liabilities gave us another hole that could not be filled without back-breaking pain, like the two [or three] we already have:<br/>
Medicare, Medicaid, and a little further down the road, Social Security OAS.</p>

<p>The truth is that the government is:<br/>
- the single largest payer for healthcare in America, <br/>
- the regulator of the health insurance industry,<br/>
- the entity that determines our benefits via "Medicare Guidelines"<br/>
- has public options are a disaster (Medicare/Medicaid)</p>
